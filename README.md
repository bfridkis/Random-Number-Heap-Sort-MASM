2. Launch "Project.sln". (Requires Microsoft Visual Studio.)
3. Using the "Debug" menu, select "Start Without Debugging" (ctrl + F5).
(4). If presented a window with the message "This project is out of date", click "Yes" for "Would you like to build it?".
(5). If build error results, right-click "Solution 'Project'" in "Solution Explorer" (right-side of screen), 
  and select "Retarget Solution". Click "Ok" in resulting window.
(6). Repeat step 3.
